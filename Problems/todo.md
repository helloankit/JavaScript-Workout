1. Magic of 3
   A number ending with 3 will have a multiple which is all 1. EgÂ­ multiple of 3 is 111 and of 13 is 111111. Given a number ending with 3 find its least multiple which is all 1. The 2 multiple of the given number can be beyond the range of int,long etc. Optimize for time.

2. Most Frequent
   Given an integer array, find the most frequent number and it's count in the array. Write the
   code in O(1) space. Eg 1 , 3, 4, 5, 2, 2, 3, 2 Output Most frequent number is 2. The
   frequency is 3. Return the output as string in 'number: frequency' format. e.g. 2: 3 (Please note the space after : and frequency. If multiple numbers have the same highest frequency return the smallest number.

3. Maximize
   A swap operation M on an array is defined where you can only swap the
   adjacent elements. Given an array containing digits and n swap
   operations(defined as below), maximize the value of the array.
   Example: Array 1, 2, 4, 3 (value = 1243), Number of swaps 2
   Output 4,1,2,3 (value = 4123).

4. Remove the duplicates from the array without extra space.
5. Merge two unsorted array into a single sorted array. No extra space are allowed.
6. Implement Merge Sort in Linked List.
7. Infinite curry
